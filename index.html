        As usual, I only made minimal changes to the game to preserve the "original experience" as much as possible. A few notable changes:
        1. BT should wake up when you have missiles, which may not always be the case on your first visit to the room. I also removed the gray doors in the room so you have some flexibility. However, there are some BT doors in the early game that normally don't matter (?), so you should kill BT at the earliest opportunity to avoid getting locked in somewhere.
        2. Similarly, there are also some croc-locked gray doors that are normally not accessible in a normal playthrough, so my advice is to kill Croc from the normal direction at the earliest opportunity to avoid getting locked out.
        3. Plasma location is now accessible. (As it should be?)
        4. The debug room doors are no longer powerbomb doors: they are special G3 doors that unlock when you have defeated all of Draygon, Kraid, and Phantoon. So that's the new win-con! Thanks to neen for the G3 door patch.
