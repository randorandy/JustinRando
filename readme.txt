WEB ROLLER
The most accessible way to use this randomizer is the web roller here:
https://randorandy.github.io/JustinRando/

LOCAL DOWNLOAD
If you prefer an offline or custom experience, you may want to use python3 and roll locally:
1.download this repository
2.place a copy of the Return of Justin rom in the roms folder - it must be named Justin.sfc
3.run Main.py in console
This should create a randomized rom with the given name in the roms folder and a spoiler log (.txt) in the spoilers folder.

GAMEPLAY
As usual, I only made minimal changes to the game to preserve the "original experience" as much as possible. A few notable changes:
1. BT should wake up when you have missiles, which may not always be the case on your first visit to the room. I also removed the gray doors in the room so you have some flexibility. However, there are some BT doors in the early game that normally don't matter (?), so you should kill BT at the earliest opportunity to avoid getting locked in somewhere.
2. Similary, there are also some croc-locked gray doors that are normally not accessible in a normal playthrough, so my advice is to kill Croc from the normal direction at the earliest opportunity to avoid getting locked out.
3. Plasma location is now accessible. (As it should be?)
4. The debug room doors are no longer powerbomb doors: they are special G3 doors that unlock when you have defeated all of Draygon, Kraid, and Phantoon. So that's the new win-con! Thanks to neen for the G3 door patch.

FAIR WARNING
This logic has been somewhat tested, but if you find a logical issue, please contact me and I would love to improve the logic file.

THANKS
Thanks to beauxq, and without the Subversion rando none of these other projects would have been possible for me:
